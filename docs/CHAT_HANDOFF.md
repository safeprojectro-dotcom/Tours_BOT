# Chat Handoff

## Project
Tours_BOT

## Current Status
The project is ready to continue from the **latest approved checkpoint**: **Phase 6 / Step 29 completed** — **narrow** admin order **move-to-another-tour/date** mutation: **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/move`** with body **`target_tour_id`**, **`target_boarding_point_id`** (**`app/services/admin_order_move_write.py`**). Eligibility is guarded by Step **28** **`compute_move_readiness`** (same predicates as **`can_consider_move`** on detail); **no** payment-row writes, **no** reconciliation/webhook changes, **no** public catalog/Mini App or customer booking/payment/waitlist/handoff flow changes.

**Admin order read** on **`GET /admin/orders/{order_id}`** (unchanged in role): **Step 16** correction visibility, **Step 17** action preview, **Step 27** lifecycle mapping (incl. **`ready_for_departure_paid`**), **Step 28** move-readiness decision-support (**`can_consider_move`**, **`move_blockers`**, **`move_readiness_hint`** — **`app/services/admin_order_move_readiness.py`**). Read-only fields do **not** authorize a move; the **POST** enforces readiness in the service layer.

Order **write** surface: **`app/services/admin_order_write.py`** — **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/mark-cancelled-by-operator`** (Step **23**), **`mark-duplicate`** (Step **24**), **`mark-no-show`** (Step **25**), **`mark-ready-for-departure`** (Step **26**); **`app/services/admin_order_move_write.py`** — **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/move`** (Step **29**); handoff writes Steps **19–22** (**`app/services/admin_handoff_write.py`**).

**Agreed narrow semantics (combined):**
- **`mark-in-review`:** **`open` → `in_review`**; **`in_review` → idempotent success** (no extra write); **`closed` → 400**; missing handoff → **404**.
- **`close`:** **`in_review` → `closed`**; **`closed` → idempotent success**; **`open` → 400** (`handoff_close_not_allowed`); **any other unexpected status → same client error shape** (narrow safe rejection); missing handoff → **404**. Admin **`close`** is intentionally **not** a shortcut from **`open`** — operators are expected to use **`mark-in-review`** first.
- **`assign`** (Step **21**): body **`{ "assigned_operator_id": <users.id> }`**. Only **`open`** or **`in_review`**; **`closed` → 400** (`handoff_assign_not_allowed`). Operator user must exist (**`handoff_assign_operator_not_found`**). **First** set of **`assigned_operator_id`** from **`null`**, or **idempotent** repeat with the **same** id — **reassigning to a different operator when one is already set** → **400** (`handoff_reassign_not_allowed`) — **no unassign** in this slice (still).
- **`reopen`** (Step **22**): **`closed` → `open`**; **`open` → idempotent success**; **`in_review` → 400** (`handoff_reopen_not_allowed`); missing handoff → **404**. Only **`status`** is updated; **`assigned_operator_id` is preserved** (not cleared) on reopen.
- **`mark-cancelled-by-operator`** (Step **23**): **active temporary hold** only (`booking_status=reserved`, `payment_status=awaiting_payment`, `cancellation_status=active`, `reservation_expires_at` **not** `null`); **`payment_status=paid` → 400**; already **`cancellation_status=cancelled_by_operator` → idempotent**; any other disallowed combination → **400**; missing order → **404**; on success: seat restore (same narrow rule as **reservation expiry**), `payment_status→unpaid`, `cancellation_status→cancelled_by_operator`, `reservation_expires_at→null`, **`booking_status` unchanged**; **no** payment-row mutation, **no** refund/reconciliation/webhook change. **Order read** (**Steps 16–17**) still exposes lifecycle, correction visibility, and action preview (unchanged).
- **`mark-duplicate`** (Step **24**): **active temporary hold** (same predicate as Step **23**) **or** **expired unpaid hold** (`reserved` + `unpaid` + `cancelled_no_payment`); **`payment_status=paid` → 400**; already **`cancellation_status=duplicate` → idempotent**; active hold: seat restore + `unpaid` / `duplicate` / `reservation_expires_at→null`; expired hold: **only** `cancellation_status→duplicate` (no duplicate seat restore); **no** payment-row mutation, **no** merge flow. **Order read** fields unchanged in meaning.
- **`mark-no-show`** (Step **25**): **confirmed** + **paid** + **`cancellation_status=active`** only; **`tour.departure_datetime` must be in the past** (UTC); already **`booking_status=no_show`** and **`cancellation_status=no_show` → idempotent**; wrong statuses → **400**; valid statuses but **departure not in past** → **400** (`reason` **`departure_not_in_past`**); on success: **`booking_status`/`cancellation_status` → `no_show`**; **`payment_status` unchanged**; **no** seat restoration, **no** payment-row mutation; missing order or missing tour → **404**.
- **`mark-ready-for-departure`** (Step **26**): **confirmed** + **paid** + **`cancellation_status=active`** only; **`tour.departure_datetime` must be strictly in the future** (UTC); already **`booking_status=ready_for_departure`** + paid + active → **idempotent**; departure not in future → **400** (`reason` **`departure_not_in_future`**); on success: **`booking_status` → `ready_for_departure` only**; **`payment_status` / `cancellation_status` unchanged**; **no** seat mutation, **no** payment-row mutation; missing order or tour → **404**. **Step 27** adds read-side **`ready_for_departure_paid`** lifecycle labeling for that steady state (see below).
- **Lifecycle read (Step 27):** **`ready_for_departure_paid`** applies only to **`ready_for_departure` + paid + active**; list filter **`lifecycle_kind=ready_for_departure_paid`** matches **`describe_order_admin_lifecycle`**; action preview treats this like **confirmed paid** (clean / no spurious **`manual_review`** from lifecycle alone). **Not** a mutation; **no** repository writes.
- **Move readiness (Step 28):** **`can_consider_move`**, **`move_blockers`**, **`move_readiness_hint`** on **`GET /admin/orders/{order_id}`** only; grounded in persisted order/tour + lifecycle + correction + open handoffs; blocker codes include **`payment_correction_manual_review`**, **`open_handoff_open`**, **`order_not_paid`**, **`cancellation_not_active`**, **`lifecycle_not_move_candidate`**, **`tour_departure_not_in_future`**. **Read-only** — hints **do not** perform a move by themselves.
- **Move mutation (Step 29):** **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/move`** — rejects with **`order_move_not_ready`** when Step **28**-style readiness would block; validates target tour + boarding on target tour; same-tour same-boarding **idempotent**; same-tour different-boarding updates **`boarding_point_id`** only; cross-tour restores source seats and deducts target (**no** oversell); **`total_amount`** and **payment rows** unchanged by policy.

**Step 18** read API: **`GET /admin/handoffs`**, **`GET /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}`** (**`is_open`**, **`needs_attention`**, **`age_bucket`**, **`assigned_operator_id`**). **Still not implemented:** **unassign**, broader **reassignment** policy redesign, full **operator workflow engine**, **notifications** from admin handoff actions, **public** customer handoff flow changes, **refund / capture / cancel-payment** admin actions, **broad** order workflow editor, **merge** tooling, **move audit/history** visibility (forward: **Step 30** — see **Next Safe Step**), **full** admin SPA.

**Phase 6 / Steps 1–29** (completed): **`ADMIN_API_TOKEN`**; tours, boarding, translations, archive/unarchive; orders **16–17** (read + preview) + **Steps 27–28** (lifecycle **`ready_for_departure_paid`** + move-readiness hints) + **Step 29** (narrow **move** **POST**) + **Steps 23–26** (cancel + duplicate + no-show + ready-for-departure); handoff **queue read** + **four** narrow mutations (**status progression + assign + reopen**).

Earlier: **Phase 5 (Mini App MVP) accepted** for MVP/staging; **Phase 5 / Step 20** was docs-only consolidation (`docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md`).

**Next work:** **Phase 6 / Step 30** — see **Next Safe Step**.

### Operational note (production — Step 6 schema recovery)
After Step 6 backend shipped to Railway **before** production Postgres had applied Alembic revision **`20260405_04`**, the missing column **`tours.cover_media_reference`** caused **`ProgrammingError` / `UndefinedColumn`** and **500**s on routes that load tours (e.g. **`/mini-app/catalog`**, **`/mini-app/bookings`**). Root cause was **schema mismatch**, not Mini App UI logic. **Recovery completed:** migrations applied against the Railway DB (using the **public** Postgres URL and a local driver URL such as **`postgresql+psycopg://...`** where internal hostnames are not resolvable), backend **redeployed**, **`/health`**, catalog, and bookings smoke-checked. **Going forward:** any schema-changing step must include **migration apply → redeploy → smoke** for affected endpoints. Details: **`docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md` section 17**.

## Current Phase

**Current phase (forward work):** **Phase 6 — Admin Panel MVP**. **Completed through Phase 6 / Step 29**; **next implementation checkpoint: Phase 6 / Step 30** (see **Next Safe Step**).

**Latest approved checkpoint:** **Phase 6 / Step 29** — **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/move`** (narrow move mutation; **`AdminOrderMoveWriteService`**); guarded by Step **28** readiness; **no** payment-row or reconciliation changes. **Steps 16–17** + **27** + **28** remain the admin order **read** story on detail (lifecycle, correction, preview, move-readiness). **Steps 23–26** + **29** are the current **order** **write** slices alongside handoff **19–22**. **Still not via `/admin/*`:** **move audit/history** read slice (until **Step 30**), **unassign**, broader **reassignment** redesign, **notifications** from admin handoff actions, **refund / capture / cancel-payment**, **broad** order editor, **merge** tooling, **full** admin SPA, **publication**, **bulk** ops, **hard-delete** tour. Internal **ops** JSON stays **separate** from **`/admin/*`**. Still **no** route/itinerary editor beyond current boarding slices.

**Earlier checkpoints:** Phase 6 / Steps 1–7 (foundation through core tour patch); Phase 6 / Steps 8–10 (boarding create / patch / delete); Phase 6 / Steps 11–12 (tour translation upsert/delete); Phase 6 / Steps 13–14 (boarding point translation upsert/delete); Phase 6 / Step 15 (tour archive/unarchive); Phase 6 / Step 16 (order detail payment correction visibility); Phase 6 / Step 17 (order detail action preview); Phase 6 / Step 18 (admin handoff queue read API); Phase 6 / Step 19 (admin handoff mark-in-review); Phase 6 / Step 20 (admin handoff close-only); Phase 6 / Step 21 (admin handoff assign); Phase 6 / Step 22 (admin handoff reopen); Phase 6 / Step 23 (admin mark-cancelled-by-operator); Phase 6 / Step 24 (admin mark-duplicate); Phase 6 / Step 25 (admin mark-no-show); Phase 6 / Step 26 (admin mark-ready-for-departure); Phase 6 / Step 27 (admin lifecycle **`ready_for_departure_paid`** read refinement); Phase 6 / Step 28 (admin order move-readiness read-only fields); Phase 6 / Step 29 (admin order narrow **move** mutation); Phase 5 accepted + Phase 5 Step 20 docs (`docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md`).

**Phase 5 (closed for MVP):** Execution checkpoints **Steps 4–19** are summarized in `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md` and per-step notes under `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_*_NOTES.md`; **Phase 5 / Step 20** was documentation/consolidation only (no intended production-code churn for acceptance).

**Forward:** implement **Phase 6 / Step 30** only as defined in **Next Safe Step** — do **not** use legacy Phase 5 “next step” prompts for new code.

**Optional follow-ups** (not Phase 5 blockers; prioritize with product): Telegram Web App init-data validation for Mini App APIs, real payment provider (PSP), broader handoff/waitlist customer notifications.

`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` lists phases 1–9; **Step N** labels in **this** file are **project checkpoints** (not substeps inside the plan table).

  - implemented through `PaymentEntryService`
  - private bot now supports continue-to-payment for an existing temporary reservation
  - validates that:
    - order belongs to the user
    - order is still `reserved`
    - order is still `awaiting_payment`
    - order is not canceled
    - order has not expired
  - creates a minimal payment session/payment record tied to the order
  - reuses latest pending payment session instead of creating duplicates
  - payment step response now shows:
    - reservation reference
    - payment session reference
    - amount due
    - reservation expiry
  - uses a minimal mock/provider-agnostic payment-entry foundation
  - nothing is marked as paid yet

- Phase 4 / Step 2 completed
  - payment reconciliation slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/payment_reconciliation.py`
  - reconciliation now consumes a verified, provider-agnostic payment result payload
  - matching payment and linked order are locked during reconciliation
  - optional amount/currency validation is applied
  - confirmed payment now:
    - sets payment status to `paid`
    - updates order `payment_status` to `paid`

- Phase 4 / Step 4 completed
  - first reservation expiry automation slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/reservation_expiry.py`
  - thin worker entry added in `app/workers/reservation_expiry.py`

    - set `payment_status=unpaid`
    - set `cancellation_status=cancelled_no_payment`
    - clear `reservation_expires_at`
  - seats are restored safely to the related tour
  - expiry behavior is idempotent and PostgreSQL-first

- Phase 4 / Step 5 completed

  - first payment-pending reminder worker slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/payment_pending_reminder.py`
  - thin worker entry added in `app/workers/payment_pending_reminder.py`
  - due reminder selection now covers active temporary reservations that are approaching expiry
  - current reminder window is the first narrow slice only:
    - payment pending shortly before reservation expiry
  - reminder preparation reuses existing notification dispatch groundwork
  - repeated execution stays safe because this slice does not mutate order/payment state or perform real delivery yet

- Phase 4 / Step 8 completed
  - first real `telegram_private` notification delivery slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/notification_delivery.py`
  - minimal delivery adapter/service boundary added for prepared dispatches
  - payment-pending reminder delivery slice added on top of the existing reminder groundwork
  - delivery result handling stays explicit and testable

- Phase 4 / Step 9 completed
  - notification outbox / persistence groundwork added
  - notification outbox model, repository, and service added
  - deterministic dispatch-key dedupe now persists pending notification entries safely
  - payment-pending reminder outbox slice added for enqueueing due reminder dispatches

- Phase 4 / Step 10 completed
  - notification outbox processing slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/notification_outbox_processing.py`
  - pending outbox entries can be picked up in narrow batches for processing
  - processing reuses the existing delivery service and marks entries delivered or failed explicitly

- Phase 4 / Step 11 completed
  - notification outbox recovery groundwork added
  - implemented through `app/services/notification_outbox_recovery.py`
  - failed and stale-processing outbox entries can be safely recovered to `pending`
  - repeated recovery execution stays explicit and repeat-safe

- Phase 4 / Step 12 completed
  - notification outbox retry execution slice added
  - implemented through `app/services/notification_outbox_retry_execution.py`
  - recovered or targeted pending outbox entries can be reprocessed through the existing processing path
  - retry execution remains narrow and does not add scheduler/orchestrator complexity

- Phase 4 / Step 13 completed
  - predeparture reminder groundwork added
  - implemented through `app/services/predeparture_reminder.py` and `app/services/predeparture_reminder_outbox.py`
  - `predeparture_reminder` event support added to notification preparation
  - eligible confirmed, paid, active orders departing within the reminder window can now be prepared and enqueued for `telegram_private`
  - repeated prepare/enqueue execution stays dedupe-friendly and state-safe

- Phase 4 / Step 14 completed
  - departure-day reminder groundwork added
  - implemented through `app/services/departure_day_reminder.py` and `app/services/departure_day_reminder_outbox.py`
  - `departure_day_reminder` event support added to notification preparation
  - eligible confirmed, paid, active same-day departure orders can now be prepared and enqueued for `telegram_private`
  - repeated prepare/enqueue execution stays dedupe-friendly and state-safe

- Phase 4 / Step 15 completed
  - post-trip reminder groundwork added
  - implemented through `app/services/post_trip_reminder.py` and `app/services/post_trip_reminder_outbox.py`
  - `post_trip_reminder` event support added to notification preparation
  - eligible confirmed, paid, active returned trips within the reminder window can now be prepared and enqueued for `telegram_private`
  - repeated prepare/enqueue execution stays dedupe-friendly and state-safe

### Phase 5
- Phase 5 / Step 1 completed
  - Mini App UX definition added in `docs/MINI_APP_UX.md`

  - Mini App reservation **preparation** UI (seat count, boarding point, preparation-only summary)
  - preparation endpoints: `GET /mini-app/tours/{tour_code}/preparation`, `GET /mini-app/tours/{tour_code}/preparation-summary`
  - service: `app/services/mini_app_reservation_preparation.py`
  - scope kept narrow:
    - preparation-only — **no** real reservation/order creation in this step
    - no payment UI
    - no waitlist flow
    - no handoff/operator workflow
    - no Mini App auth/init expansion

- Phase 5 / Step 5 completed
  - commit: `929988f` — `feat: add mini app reservation creation and payment start`
  - real Mini App temporary reservation creation added
  - implemented through thin Mini App glue on top of existing service-layer foundations
  - Mini App now supports:
    - real temporary reservation creation from preparation flow
    - reservation success screen with:
      - reservation reference
      - amount to pay
      - payment status
      - reservation expiry / timer-friendly text
    - payment start / continue-to-payment from Mini App
    - payment screen with:

  - payment reconciliation remains unchanged and is still the only source of truth for paid-state transition
  - scope kept narrow:
    - no waitlist workflow
    - no handoff/operator workflow
    - no Mini App auth/init expansion
    - no my bookings screen
    - no provider-specific payment integration
    - no admin/group/content changes

### Phase 5 / Step 5 manual local validation
- local backend startup passed

  - catalog
  - tour detail
  - reservation preparation
  - preparation summary
  - confirm reservation
  - reservation success state
  - reservation overview
  - payment entry
  - payment screen
- current payment screen remains honest/provider-neutral and does not mark anything as paid before backend reconciliation

- Phase 5 / Step 6 completed
  - commit: `<PUT_COMMIT_HASH_HERE>` — `feat: add mini app bookings and booking status view`
  - Mini App My Bookings screen added
  - Mini App Booking Detail / Status View added
  - thin Mini App facade layer added for user-facing booking/payment state translation
  - added:
    - `GET /mini-app/bookings`
    - `GET /mini-app/orders/{id}/booking-status`
  - Flet Mini App now supports:
    - bookings list
    - booking detail / status view
    - state-based CTA:
      - `Pay now`
      - `Browse tours`
      - `Back to bookings`
  - current facade behavior includes:
    - active temporary hold -> `Pay now`
    - expired hold before worker cleanup -> `Browse tours`
    - released hold after worker cleanup -> human-readable released/expired state + `Browse tours`
    - confirmed/paid booking -> `Back to bookings`
  - payment summary is reused through existing read/summary services
  - payment reconciliation remains unchanged and is still the only source of truth for paid-state transition
  - scope kept narrow:
    - no waitlist workflow
    - no handoff/operator workflow
    - no Mini App auth/init expansion
    - no provider-specific checkout
    - no refund flow
    - no admin/group/content changes

### Phase 5 / Step 6 test checkpoint
- tests run:
  - `python -m unittest tests.unit.test_api_mini_app tests.unit.test_services_mini_app_booking_facade tests.unit.test_services_mini_app_booking -v`
- result:
  - all listed tests passed

- Phase 5 / Step 7 completed
  - commit: `<PUT_COMMIT_HASH_HERE>` — `feat: add mini app help placeholder and language settings`
  - Mini App help placeholder added
  - Mini App language/settings screens added
  - added:
    - `GET /mini-app/help`
    - `GET /mini-app/settings`
    - `POST /mini-app/language-preference`
  - Flet Mini App now supports:
    - `/help`
    - `/settings`
    - help/settings entry points from high-friction screens
    - server-backed language hydration after startup
    - language preference update through the existing user context path
  - current help behavior stays honest:
    - support/help information is available
    - real operator handoff from Mini App is still not implemented
  - language preference is persisted through existing Telegram user context service behavior
  - scope kept narrow:
    - no waitlist workflow
    - no real handoff/operator workflow
    - no Mini App auth/init expansion
    - no provider-specific checkout
    - no refund flow
    - no admin/group/content changes

### Phase 5 — extended execution (Steps 8–20, historical)

These steps are **closed** for the Phase 5 MVP acceptance narrative; detail lives in `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md` and `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_*_NOTES.md`. This subsection records **durable facts** and a **compact map** (not a live “next step” checklist).

**Staging / ops facts (still relevant):**
- Typical hosted layout: **API backend** + **Telegram bot (webhook)** + **Mini App UI** as separate processes/services; **PostgreSQL** is the staging DB; `TEST_BELGRADE_001` is a staging-oriented test tour.
- **Data hygiene:** accumulated staging holds/orders can make a tour look sold out; `reset_test_belgrade_tour_state.py` resets the test tour and related artifacts when needed before smoke tests.
- **Lazy expiry** (Step 9): expiry can run without relying on a dedicated cron for several paths; configurable override **`TEMP_RESERVATION_TTL_MINUTES`** (defaults preserve the 6h/24h rule family documented elsewhere).
- **Mock payment completion** (Step 10): `ENABLE_MOCK_PAYMENT_COMPLETION` + `POST /mini-app/orders/{id}/mock-payment-complete` funnels through the same **`PaymentReconciliationService`** path as webhooks.
- **Expired hold DB shape** (admin/read-model caution): expired unpaid holds may combine **`booking_status=reserved`** with **`payment_status=unpaid`**, **`cancellation_status=cancelled_no_payment`**, **`reservation_expires_at=null`** — see `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md` for interpretation risk.

**Compact step map (pointers):**
- **Step 8–8C:** private chat ↔ Mini App staging alignment; scroll/shell i18n iterations; smoke checklist — see early step notes / commit history.
- **Step 9–9A:** lazy expiry + configurable TTL — notes above.
- **Step 10:** mock payment completion — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_10_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 11:** My bookings sections — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_11_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 12:** booking detail + payment UX hardening — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_12_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 12A / 12B:** private chat message cleanup + `/start` `/tours` edit/replace behavior — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_12A_NOTES.md`, `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_12B_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 13:** support/handoff entry — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_13_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 14:** waitlist interest entry — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_14_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 15–17:** internal ops JSON queues + claim/close — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_15_NOTES.md` … `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_17_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 18:** waitlist status visibility — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_18_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 19:** My bookings history compaction — `docs/PHASE_5_STEP_19_NOTES.md`.
- **Step 20:** documentation-only acceptance/consolidation — `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md`.

**Still not done (product/ops; not Phase 5 MVP acceptance blockers):** real PSP integration, richer mock failure/cancel paths, production Telegram Web App init-data validation for Mini App APIs, full operator inbox/notifications — track via `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md`.

### Phase 6
- Phase 6 / Step 1 completed
  - **Config:** `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` in `app/core/config.py`; documented in `.env.example`
  - **Auth dependency:** `app/api/admin_auth.py` — `require_admin_api_token` (Bearer or `X-Admin-Token`; same ergonomics as ops queue)
  - **Routes:** `app/api/routes/admin.py` — `GET /admin/overview`, `GET /admin/tours`, `GET /admin/orders` (lists; wired in `app/api/router.py`)
  - **Read-side:** `app/services/admin_read.py`, `app/services/admin_order_lifecycle.py` — orders expose **`lifecycle_kind`** / **`lifecycle_summary`** instead of relying on raw enums alone for ambiguous expired holds
  - **Repositories:** `TourRepository.list_by_departure_desc`, `OrderRepository.list_recent_for_admin` (read-only lists)
  - **Tests:** `tests/unit/test_api_admin.py`, `tests/unit/test_services_admin_order_lifecycle.py`

## Current Architecture State

### Ready
- **bot layer** — Telegram private chat; thin handlers; service-driven
- **api layer** — FastAPI; public routes + Mini App routes + payments webhooks + **internal ops** JSON endpoints + **admin API** (`/admin/*`, `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`: overview, tours/orders **lists** with **optional read-only filters** incl. **`lifecycle_kind=ready_for_departure_paid`** (Step **27**), **`GET /admin/handoffs`** and **`GET /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}`** handoff queue visibility, **`POST /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}/mark-in-review`** (Step **19**), **`POST /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}/close`** (Step **20**), **`POST /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}/assign`** (Step **21**), **`POST /admin/handoffs/{handoff_id}/reopen`** (Step **22**), **`GET /admin/orders/{order_id}`** order detail with **Step 16** correction + **Step 17** action-preview + **Step 27** lifecycle mapping + **Step 28** move-readiness fields (**`can_consider_move`**, **`move_blockers`**, **`move_readiness_hint`**), **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/mark-cancelled-by-operator`** (Step **23**), **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/mark-duplicate`** (Step **24**), **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/mark-no-show`** (Step **25**), **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/mark-ready-for-departure`** (Step **26**), **`POST /admin/orders/{order_id}/move`** (Step **29**), **tour + order detail** incl. **`cover_media_reference`**, **`POST /admin/tours`** create **core** tours, **`POST /admin/tours/{tour_id}/archive`** and **`POST /admin/tours/{tour_id}/unarchive`**, **`PUT /admin/tours/{tour_id}/cover`** for **one** media reference string, **`PATCH /admin/tours/{tour_id}`** for **core** field updates only, **`POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE`** boarding points, **`PUT` / `DELETE`** **`/admin/tours/{tour_id}/translations/{language_code}`** for **tour** translations, **`PUT` / `DELETE`** **`/admin/boarding-points/{boarding_point_id}/translations/{language_code}`** for **boarding** translations)
- **services layer** — business rules and orchestration
- **repositories layer** — persistence-oriented data access
- **mini_app** — Flet Mini App UI (separate deploy surface in staging); **MVP accepted** for agreed scope (`docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md`); **no business logic in the frontend** — UI calls APIs only
- **booking/payment core** — temporary reservations, payment entry, idempotent reconciliation, lazy expiry, staging mock payment completion path when enabled
- **waitlist / handoff (MVP)** — customer interest/support entry; **internal ops** JSON retains separate tooling; **`/admin/*`** has queue **read** (Step **18**) + narrow **`mark-in-review` / `close` / `assign` / `reopen`** (Steps **19–22**) — assignment **narrow** (no reassign-to-other-operator once set; **no unassign**); **reopen** restores **`open`** from **`closed`** and **preserves `assigned_operator_id`**; **not** a full operator inbox or customer notification suite

### Architecture boundaries (non-negotiable)
- **PostgreSQL-first** for MVP-critical behavior; do not treat SQLite as source of truth for booking/payment paths
- **Service layer** owns business logic; **repositories** stay persistence-oriented; **route layer** stays thin (verify/parse/delegate)
- **Payment reconciliation** remains the single place for confirmed paid-state transitions on orders
- **Mini App / any web UI**: presentation only — no duplicated booking/payment rules in the client

### Not Implemented Yet
- **Next (Step 30):** first narrow **admin order move/history visibility** slice — **read-only** operator context after Step **29** moves (e.g. minimal audit summary or capped history on **`GET /admin/orders/{order_id}`** or **one** sub-path — **exact shape product-defined**); **no** payment-row mutations, **no** reconciliation rewrite, **no** broad move workflow engine — see **Next Safe Step**.
- **Still postponed:** admin **refund / capture / cancel-payment**, **broad** order status editor, **merge** tooling, **payment reconciliation** rewrite, handoff **unassign**, broader **reassignment** policy, full **operator queue/workflow engine**, **notifications** from admin actions, **full** admin SPA, **publication**, **bulk** ops — per plan / product.
- **Phase 7–9:** group assistant, handoff at scale, content assistant, analytics — per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Next Safe Step

**Phase 6 / Step 30 — first narrow admin order move/history visibility slice** — **read-only** extension so operators can see **conservative** context about **admin moves** after Step **29** (e.g. **when**, **from/to tour** identifiers, **boarding** — minimal fields or a **small capped list**, not a full workflow editor). Prefer **extending** existing **`GET /admin/orders/{order_id}`** / **`AdminOrderDetailRead`** patterns unless product requires a separate sub-resource. **Persist** only what the step explicitly defines (may be a **narrow** audit table or denormalized snapshot — **product/schema choice** in the prompt). **No** payment-row mutations, **no** reconciliation rewrite, **no** public catalog/Mini App or customer-flow changes, **no** refund workflow in the same slice.

### Goal
Operational **visibility** into **narrow** moves already permitted by Step **29**, without turning admin into a **broad** move engine.

### Safe scope boundaries
- **Read-first**; **one** coherent visibility surface; **thin** route; **service-layer** assembly; **repositories** persistence-oriented.

### Explicitly not in Step 30
- Payment-admin **refund/capture/cancel-payment**, **merge** tooling, **broad** order editor, **full** admin SPA, **notification** engine from admin actions, **second** mutating move endpoint (unless product documents a **tiny** exception — default **no**).

**Completed step references:** `docs/CURSOR_PROMPT_PHASE_6_STEP_1.md` … `docs/CURSOR_PROMPT_PHASE_6_STEP_29.md` (historical).  
**Plan:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 6 — order oversight / restricted updates, taken as **narrow slices**).

## Recommended Next Prompt
Implement **Phase 6 / Step 30** (**narrow move/history visibility** — read-only, per **Next Safe Step** and product) using **`docs/CHAT_HANDOFF.md`**, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md`, `docs/TECH_SPEC_TOURS_BOT.md`, and `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`. Add **`docs/CURSOR_PROMPT_PHASE_6_STEP_30.md`** when starting — **do not** use legacy Phase 5 “next step” prompts for new work. **Alternative** forward slice (only with explicit product approval): first narrow **admin payment** mutation — **not** the default handoff path here.

## Important Technical Notes

- PostgreSQL is the primary target database
- do not treat SQLite as source of truth for booking/payment-critical behavior
- repository layer must stay persistence-oriented only
- service layer must stay separate from repositories
- handlers must stay thin and service-driven
- enum persistence was already fixed and must not be broken again
- current bot foundation uses `MemoryStorage()` as an early-stage temporary choice
- bot process and backend process should remain separable
- temporary reservation creation already reduces `seats_available`, so later payment and expiry logic must respect this existing write behavior
- payment reconciliation is already idempotent and must remain the single place for confirmed payment state transitions
- webhook/API route layer must remain thin and must not duplicate reconciliation logic
- DB-backed test harness now disposes the engine pool centrally after class teardown
- see `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md` for accepted temporary decisions, open architectural questions, and future review triggers

## Current Bot Layer Notes

### Existing bot capabilities
- private `/start`
- explicit language selection
- language resolution/persistence for Telegram users
- `/tours`
- safe list of open tours
- safe tour detail browsing
- `/start tour_<CODE>` style deep-link handling
- guided browsing by:
  - date presets
  - destination keyword
  - budget range when safe
- reservation-preparation preview flow
- temporary reservation creation confirmation
- continue-to-payment entry for temporary reservations

### Bot constraints
- **waitlist:** interest entry exists for sold-out open tours (MVP); no group-chat waitlist UX
- **handoff:** support/contact entry exists; full operator inbox and customer notifications are **not** implemented
- **group chat:** not in scope for current MVP slices

### Mini App (Phase 5 MVP — accepted)
- End-to-end staging-realistic flow: catalog → detail → preparation → **temporary reservation** → **payment entry** → optional **mock completion** → **My bookings** (with documented limits); see `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_SUMMARY.md`
- Production **Telegram Web App init-data** validation for API identity remains a **follow-up**, not a blocker for this handoff narrative

---

## Reservation Expiration Assumption Currently Implemented

- departure in 1–3 days: 6 hours
- departure in 4+ days: 24 hours
- always capped by `sales_deadline` if earlier

This logic already exists in the temporary reservation creation slice and must be preserved unless deliberately revised.

---

## Payment Logic Status Currently Implemented

### Already implemented
- payment entry
- minimal payment session creation/reuse
- idempotent payment reconciliation
- paid result can confirm the order
- later non-paid result cannot regress a paid order
- webhook/API delivery slice with isolated signature verification and payload parsing
- provider-agnostic reconciliation entry via `POST /payments/webhooks/{provider}`

### Not yet implemented
- refund workflow
- advanced provider SDK integration
- admin-facing payment operations beyond current core flow

---

## Notification Logic Status Currently Implemented

### Already implemented
- multilingual notification preparation for:
  - temporary reservation created
  - payment pending
  - payment confirmed
  - reservation expired
- multilingual notification preparation for:
  - predeparture reminder
  - departure-day reminder
  - post-trip reminder
- notification event/type definitions
- channel-specific dispatch envelope preparation for `telegram_private`
- real `telegram_private` notification delivery
- deterministic dispatch key generation for prepared dispatches

### Not yet implemented
- group delivery
- Mini App delivery
- waitlist notifications
- handoff notifications

## New Chat Startup Prompt

Start this task as a continuation of the current project state, but in a fresh chat.

Use the following as source of truth for continuity:
- project rules
- current codebase
- docs/TECH_SPEC_TOURS_BOT.md
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- docs/CHAT_HANDOFF.md (latest approved checkpoint and **Next Safe Step**)
- docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_TECH_DEBT.md
- docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- docs/AI_ASSISTANT_SPEC.md
- docs/AI_DIALOG_FLOWS.md

Continuity rules:
- preserve the existing architecture and phase sequence
- do not repeat already completed work
- do not reintroduce previously postponed logic
- continue from the last approved checkpoint in `docs/CHAT_HANDOFF.md` (**Phase 6 / Step 29** complete; forward work: **Phase 6 / Step 30** per **Next Safe Step**)

Forward **Phase 6** work only — do not use legacy Phase 5 “next step” prompts for new implementation slices.
